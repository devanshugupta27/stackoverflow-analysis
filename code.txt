The code given below was used on the terminal arm of hive which can be invoked by typing hive onto the Linux Console.

1. Checking the data set. 
[devanshu@ubuntu]$ head answers.csv

2. Removing the header line from data
[devanshu@ubuntu]$ sed -i 1d answers.csv

3. Moving data to the HDFS:

[devanshu@ubuntu]$ hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal answers.csv /user/devanshu/ansdata
[devanshu@ubuntu]$ hdfs dfs -ls /user/devanshu/ansdata

4. Invoking hive

[devanshu@ubuntu]$ hive

5. Creating an external table 

hive > CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS answers (
	 > qid INT,
	 > i INT,
	 > qs INT,
	 > qt INT,
	 > tags STRING,
	 > qvc INT,
	 > qac INT,
	 > aid INT,
	 > j INT,
	 > as INT,
	 > at INT)
	 > ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
	 > FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
	 > STORED AS TEXTFILE
	 > location '/user/devanshu/ansdata' ;
		
OK

7. Create the ORC table

hive > CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ans (
	 > qid INT,
	 > i INT,
	 > qs INT,
	 > qt INT,
	 > tags STRING,
	 > qvc INT,
	 > qac INT,
	 > aid INT,
	 > j INT,
	 > as INT,
	 > at INT)
	 > ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
	 > FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
	 > STORED AS ORC;
	 
8. Insert the data 	from the external table to the Hive ORC table

hive > INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE ans SELECT * FROM answers;

NOTE : Using Hive to convert an external table into an ORC file format is very efficient because the conversion is a parallel and distributed action,
	   and no standalone ORC conversion tool is necessary.
	   
9. Verify that you have correctly imported the dataset.

hive > SELECT * from ans limit 3;
OK
The top three rows will be displayed.


Now, you can start the analysis.

1. What are the top 10 most common tags?

hive > SELECT ans.tags, COUNT(ans.tags) as Count_T from ans GROUP BY ans.tags ORDER BY Count_T desc limit 10;

2. What is the average time to answer a question?

hive > SELECT avg(ans.at - ans.qt) from ans;

3. What are the number of questions that got answered within 1 hour?

hive > SELECT count(ans.slno) from ans where (ans.at - ans.qt) < 3600;

4. What are the tags of questions which got answered within 1 hour?

hive > SELECT DISTINCT ans.tags from ans where (ans.at - ans.qt) < 3600;
